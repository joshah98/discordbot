## Discord Wallet Bot

This is a simple little discord bot I made to motivate my GF to cook healthy food for herself while shes abroad. Uses discord.js to recognize some simple commands, where I rate her meals and add a certain amount of virtual money to a virtual wallet. Once a limit is reached, she can cash it out to buy a bubble tea (on me)! Deployed on Heroku so I don't have to run it myself.
